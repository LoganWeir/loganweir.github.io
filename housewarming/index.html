    <h3>Why Now?</h3>
    <p>Well the house is getting deep cleaned Dec. 4th and is devoid of everything except curtains and a fire extinguisher.</p>
    <p> What better time to fill this place with stinky people! You don't even have to take your shoes off!</p>
    <h3>Food / Drink</h3>
    <p>We'll order pizza to arrive around 6 pm or so.</p>
    <p>We'll provide light/mexican beers (or maybe a keg), plus some red/white wine and champange. Maaaaybe Aperol Spritz fixings.</p>
    <p>There will be seltzers, water (if I set that utility up correctly), and a bottle of Martinelli's.</p>
    <h3>Can we bring anything?</h3>
    <p>We will have an extra camping chair or two, but if you want to sit you might want to bring your own.</p>
    <p>Drinks are welcome (there will be a cooler) and any simple snacks.</p>
    <h3>Kids?</h3>
    <p>Bring those hooligans! Ours will be there, at least until bedtime.</p>
    <h3>RSVP</h3>
    <p>Just text or email me or Bel :)</p>
