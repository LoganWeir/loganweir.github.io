    <h3>Why Now?</h3>
    <p>Well the house is getting deep cleaned Dec. 4th and is devoid of everything except curtains and a fire extinguisher.</p>
    <p> What better time to fill this place with stinky people! You don't even have to take your shoes off!</p>
    <i>We will have some extra camping chairs but please bring your own if you want a chance to sit</i>
